# Star Pattern Fragments: Accessing Knowledge Graphs through Star Patterns
A github repository for Star Pattern Fragments server and client in Java (and client in Node.js).

This Readme and repository are works in progress. The SPF version available here is the one used for experiments in our paper (see also our website at http://relweb.cs.aau.dk/spf/).

The server is available in the SPF.Server/ folder.
The client is available for both Java (SPF.Client/) and Node.js (Client.js/).
